# CV-19-Project

I started this project on my own in April 2020. I wanted to know the ratio of infected per tested cases per area 
(country in this case). I took what I learned in Computational Statics (a lot of R) and applied it to this problem. 
Since I was using Excel to plot my data, I "factored out" the countries into their own columns. Unfortunately, the 
data-set doesn't include parameters like health-based investments, tactics, plans, etc. Otherwise, I would have created a 
regression model.

If anythin else, this is an example of separating values of a column into their own columns.
